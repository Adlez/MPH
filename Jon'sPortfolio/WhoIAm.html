				First thing's first, I'm going to be immortal. You could be too with the advancement of digital storage and AI, you could

Anyway, I'm a young adult male who's life has so far been filled with ups and downs like everyone else. I like videogames <br>
similar to a lot of people my age. I eat food, sleep, drink juice and milk, just like anyone else. 
<br> Actually, not so much milk anymore. Lactose Intolerant as of late 2014. <br>
At this point you're probably wondering what makes me different from everybody else, right? <br>
Many people end up achieving the same result, but how quickly they arrive at it and the methods they use all differ. <br>
For example, the three little pigs all bit a home for themselves. One out of hay, one of sticks, and one of bricks. <br>
The pigs that built the hay and stick houses were eaten, but the wolf couldn't make it into the brick house (maybe not initially depending on the version) <br>
and that is me, I built the brick house.
<br><br>
My favourite videogame series are The Legend of Zelda and Halo, but my favourite game is Fable: The Lost Chapters <br>
(Fable Anniversary, the HD remake was so buggy when it was released I stopped playing it on the xbox.)

I've written up a few starts to some novels I'd like to finish. These stories are based on events that happened in a tabletop-pen and paper-rpg<br>
that I have been running as the Game Master for a few years now. I built the game from scratch, creating all the mechanics and calculations myself.<br>
I've gotten help from a friend when doing the skills and spells simply because the size of the lists are so large. But something <br>
I started planning for a little while ago was to  make a system suited to a videogame, which I plan on making.<br>
I want to make an entire series of books, comics, games, web series, movies, etc, based on the world I created. And I will. <br>
Something I think is very important in games is the AI, and if I'm only known for one thing in my life, I'd like it to be <br>
for creating the most advanced AI in games.</p><br>
My favourite colour is <EmeraldText> emerald green. </EmeraldText>
