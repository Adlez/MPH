				<p id="triggerJackpt1" ="#"><i>Jack</i></p><div id="Jackpt1"> Jack set down <i>Through the Marshland</i> for the third time this morning.
				A boy of fourteen years, Jack was taller and stronger than others of his age, 
				and unlike most boys he was very fond of literature. His father had been the 
				king of the country Eluryh, a peaceful country where the land is mostly rolling 
				plains with a large forest along it's south and eastern border and his mother, the 
				only angel who stayed on Terra when the others had all left. Jack's hair is an 
				unnatural blue reaching just past his neck and above his emerald eyes, his build 
				lean with muscles defined from his martial training with the city guard. 
				Of all the angelic children Jack is gifted with the most potent magical abilities, 
				earning him the jealousy of the Hurtzva twins of Albion, even his mother is impressed
				by his mastery over fire. In his room you'll see a bed never made by his hands 
				sitting atop a red and gold carpet. A black dresser containing his princely clothes, 
				his vanity mirror (covered in dust), and wall to wall shelves filled with books 
				detailing ages long past and both fictitious and true adventures, the later being 
				his favourite.</div></div>

			<p id="triggerJackpt2" ="#"><i>Jack pt ii</i></p><div id="Jackpt2"><p>“You <i>are</i> a master of the craft my friend.” Jack said, drawing the blade from its house to reveal a 
			long double edged blade. The surface whiter than the pale moon. His family crest was carved halfway between the point 
			and base of the blade on both sides, exactly mirroring each other.<br>
			“Two point three metres of pure whitesteel, you'd be hard pressed to find anything sharper or more durable anywhere.”<br>
			“How am I to draw it in battle? It's too long for my arm to pull from my back, and it will drag on the ground if I hang 
			it from my hip!” Tony motioned for Jack to hand him the sword. He did so, eager to see how the bird man had addressed the problem.<br>
			“There's a locking mechanism,” he began as he returned the sword to the scabbard, “and when you push down on 
			the handle like so,” he tilted it downwards making several clicks inside the sheath, “and voila, it pops right out!” 
			And it did, the top edge of the sheath unclasped itself from one side revealing the blade inside. It simply rose from 
			its place out of the side.<br></p> </div></div>

	<p id="triggerAOT-FBD" ="#"><i>AOT-FBD</i></p><div id="AOT-FBD"><p> 	The group continued on deeper into the forest. They made it to the fisher's camp and began searching for clues as to what 
	happened to the fishermen.<br>
	“I found something!” As everyone approached Dave he lifted up a leg he had found laying in the brush. <br>
	“You gonna eat that?” Wade pointed to the leg.<br>
	“Uh, Wade?” <br>
	“Yes Larin?” Wade had a sickening smile across his maw.<br>
	“Shut up and search for more clues.” Wade went off still smiling to himself. The rest of the group turned to the leg.
	The blue-haired man took it and raised it up to the sunlight. He looked to be thinking quite a bit about the leg when he said,<br>
	“Where are Damian and Takara?” Larin and Kat looked at eachother. <br>
	“I saw them run off a while back, why?” Dave asked.<br>
	“How far back?!”<br>
	Takara and Damian had been running through the forest, avoiding the fishhooks as they went, 
	until they finally reached the shore of a beach. They ran out into the water and watched the forest for any movement. 
	The two could see a pair of glowing yellow eyes. The girls stood in the water, waiting and watching.<br> </div>

	<p id="triggerMima" ="#"><i>Mima</i></p><div id="Mima"><p> 	Mima found herself standing in the crater she had made thousands of years ago while trying to take the sword of Eons. 
	The dirt was black, bereft of life, her spell had backfired horribly, too much butter that time. Though ultimately a failure, 
	it still impressed her that she had caused this massive hole of lifeless land to exist, <i>The sword may have had something to do
	with I'll admit, but this is a damn fine hole</i>. The first thing she did after recovering her staff, which was by no means an easy 
	task, was attempt to track down the sword. Not knowing what else to do, she decided to start at the beginning again. So here she 
	stood with the wind blowing through her hair, attempting to retrace the steps taken all those years ago.<br>
	“This is the wrong beginning.” The voice surprised her enough to cause her to jump. <i>Cheap ass jump scares.</i> She turned around to 
	see a woman standing a few feet away from her. Her outerwear did not match the era she was in, long robes that back in Mima's 
	day would have been considered royal. She could clearly see a body suit underneath, black with bright blue patterns. “I said 
	you're at the wrong beginning, are you just going to stand there like a higga, oblivious to my words?” <i>Who the hell does 
	she think she is!? Does she have any idea who she's speaking to!?</i> Mima approached the stranger, keeping herself composed all the while.<br>
	“I don't suppose you know where to start then?”
